# Weather-Dashboard

### Weather-Dashboard is an application that lets you see the weather in many different cities. When a city is searched you get current weather information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, uv index and a weather icon. The UV Index will display either a green, yellow, or red color to signify the level of UV.

### At the bottom of the current weather, the user will get a 5-day forecast of the city. It will include the date, a weather icon, the temperature and humidity for the next 5 days.

### Under the users search input, a search history will be displayed, and the user will be able to navigate through their city search history.
